# Description
This repo contains some functions for predicting fermentation and methanogenesis stoichiometry from chemical formulas based on Rittmann and McCarty's approach.
These are not polished or even completed functions but the repo is public in case users find them useful.
The `readFormula()` function is from the [biogas package](https://github.com/sashahafner/biogas).
